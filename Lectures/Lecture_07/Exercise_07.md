# Exercise 07 - Interactive Surfaces and Spaces

- Ship navigation, e.g. on the bridge of a large container vessel:
Ship navigation requires display a lot of information, like radar, GPS, weather, maps with other ships, ship status and sensors. A large interactive surface would be a great fit for displaying large ammounts of data and enabling touch interaction with graphing and charting software. A computer, laptop or tablet would not offer enough real state on their displays for this much data, and setting up mixed-reality headsets for all crew member would be a tremendous hassle. However, I recommend against touch-based controls for actually controlling and steering the ship, physical controls are much safer.

- Emergency response and coordination after a large-scale disaster:
Disaster coordination also requires a great deal of information to be displayed to a multitude of responders involved. However in this case they must also be able to input data quickly. Another large interactive surface would be the most suitable as it combines the capabilities of showing a lot of data while allowing for easy access to creating and updating existing information by all team members. Other types of devices would fragment the information into multiple displays and dividing the attention of everyone involved.

- A casual but fast-paced game for four players, such as airhockey
Given that this is not a mission critial task, we can give more importance to the enjoyment of the activity. A multiplayer game would be perfect of a AR/VR headset, where users can enjoy an augmented experience, while the 4-player limit keeps the logistics of AR/VR headsets under control. Computers and interactive surfaces are also good options, but don't sound as fun.

- Collaborative text writing for a research paper
Text writing is a 2D task by nature, and thus it does not benefit from the upsides of interactive surfaces that much. Coupled with the fact that research paper writing is an activity that requires great focus and concentration, I would say that a traditional laptop/desktop setup is the most ideal, specially considering an office environment with desk and chair.

- Air traﬀic control in an international airport
ATC is a very intense task that requires monitoring the position and state of multiple aircraft, while constantly communicating with pilots and other controllers. Classic setups mostly consist of individual desktops and big wall-mounted displays for sharing information. Another approach could be mixed reality, allowing professionals to still interact with their existing equipment but enhancing the visualization capabilities of aircraft by rendering them in the sky, which could be a more information dense system.
