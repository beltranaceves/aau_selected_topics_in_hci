# Exercise 01 - Big Issues

## Limited power supply
Blackr, a dark theme / idle screen app for AMOLED screens. Uses completely dark backgrounds with very thin fonts to reduce battery usage. I would prefer a native pitch-dark theme, but the phone manufacturer has not released it yet.
I also used a "rugged" phone for a long time because of the 10000MAh battery.

## Limited storage
Google Photos/Drive, WhatsApp chat media backups and reduced local cache

## Wireless communication channels
Approached mostly by throttling high-usage apps, depending on the connected network 4/5G vs WiFi. Limiting download/upload of heavy assets when appropriate. Here I show WhatsApp and Telegram

## Limited/different I/O capabilities
I don't use it anymore, but my previous phone had a customizable button and an RGB notification light. The Button Mapper allowed me to add extra actions to this extra button by customising the behaviour of double/triple/long presses.

## Unpredictable usage context
I make use of Android's bedtime mode to customise how apps should interact with me (Do Not Disturb, important contacts only, greyscale, disabled screen wake on notification)

## Privacy and security
I use the Brave private browser. By default, it blocks ads, trackers, third-party cookies, etc. It also blocks well-known malicious script payloads, fingerprinters, and bounce trackers. It comes with support for VPNs and the Tor network, but I don't use it.
(No, it doesn't make much sense to use a "private browser" when most of my main apps are Google-owned and thus very much tracked and sold, but the adblocker is pretty good, and one has to start somewhere).

## Sustainability
I don't use any apps with a specific focus on sustainability. A quick online search reveals similar efforts to LineageOS (alternative operating systems to Android/iOS that can support phones for much longer than manufacturers currently do) in the form of GrapheneOS or the European SailfishOS (and the Linux-based Jolla Phone).
