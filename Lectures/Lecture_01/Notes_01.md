# Mobile Information Systems
- Chapter covers the main challenges and issues of MIS
- Limited power supply
  - Trade between capacity and size/weight/portability
  - Energy consumption becomes one of the main limiting factors of the device
  - Solutions
    - Increase energy density, which requires chemistry/physics knowledge
    - Decrease consumption by optimisation
  - Biggest energy consumers:
    - Display (mostly its backlight)
    - GPS receiver, camera
    - Wireless modules (3/4/5G, WiFi, Bluetooth). Energy consumption increases with bandwidth/speed/payload, 5G >> 3G
    - Sensors (touchscreen, accelerometer/IMU)
  - Energy saving techniques:
    - Disable unused subdevices
    - Lower polling frequency
    - Move heavy computations to cloud services
- Limited storage
  - 8Gb (more like 32Gb) on entry-level devices
  - Data partially stored in cloud services to compensate
    - Requires network connection Up/Down/Sync
    - Tradeoff storage/bandwidth/energy consumption
  - Flash memory
    - Tradeoff between price/size/capacity/longevity
- Wireless communication channels
  - Basics:
    - Communication with electromagnetic waves, mostly freq between 0.5 and 5 GHz, no line-of-sight required
    - Channel capacity/throughput depends on:
      - Channel bandwidth
      - Modulation method
    - Channel sharing (time, freq slots). Requires arbritration to avoid collisions
    - Signal-to-noise ratio
    - Antennas, ideal omnidirectional does not exist, construct it from multiple ones
    - Negative effects
      - Refraction
      - Reflection
      - Absorption
      - Diffraction
      - Interference
      - Multipath scattering
    - Wireless basics:
      - WLAN (wifi?)
      - WPAN (bluetooth)
      - WiGig (60Ghz, high throughput, LOS required)
      - WWAN (2G GSM, 3G UMTS, 4/5G LTE)
      - Mesh networks
      - ISM
- Limited/different IO capabilities
  - Small screens, no physical keyboard
  - Low precision and speed
  - Less room for data
  - Use other channels (touch, gestures, motion, camera, location, vibration, sound, speech)
  - Touch
    - No haptic feedback (Phorm)
    - Occlusion
    - Precision
    - No hover state (Midas touch problem)
  - Gestures
    - Difficult discoverability and no standards (cultural differences)
  - Speech
  - Motion
    - Vibration alerts (binary channel, sometimes with patterns)
    - Motion as input:
      - Accelerometer, IMU
      - Only relative position, not accurate (3 vs 6 DOF)
      - Needs combination with GPS, marker tracking
      - Sensitive to interference
      - Use secondary device, smartwatch?
    - Vision
      - As input:
        - Barcodes, QR codes, OCR, SLAM
        - Difficult and expensive
      - As output:
        - Size/resolution: very high information density
        - Brightness/contrast important depending on technology used
- Unpredictable usage context
  - Environment
  - Location/position
  - Social context
  - Activity context
  - Recognition VERY difficult
- Privacy and security
  - Huge amounts of private and personal data on MIS: contacts, messages, emails, search history, pictures
  - Profitable data for big corpos
  - No pervasive encryption (DK chat control!)
- Sustainability
  - Short device lifecycle, even worse software updates, use of open-source alternatives, right to repair, repairable products

# Location and Networks
- RF spectrum is a precious shared resource, need for efficient usage through multiplexing
- Time-division multiple access (TDMA)
  - Static timeslots, requires synchronization in advance
  - Dynamics: carrier-sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    - Listen if channel idle, then transmit
    - (Optional) request to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS)
    - Transmit and wait for ACK
- Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)
  - Split msg into multiple freqs, single freq as the simplest case
  - WDMA (wavelength) for optical
  - OFDMA as complex variant
- Code-division multiple access (CDMA)
  - Spead-spectrum method (transmits across the spectrum)
  - "Encoding-based"
