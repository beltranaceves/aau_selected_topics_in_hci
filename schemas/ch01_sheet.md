# BIG ISSUES IN MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

1. POWER
   - Limit: battery capacity ↔ weight
   - Top consumers: Display > GPS/Camera > Wireless > Sensors
   - Save: disable modules, lower polling, offload compute

2. STORAGE
   - Flash limited; cloud solves but needs bandwidth
   - HDD vs Flash: price vs density vs power
   - Tradeoff: local storage ↔ network cost

3. WIRELESS
   - Unpredictable bandwidth/RTT
   - Physical effects: reflection, absorption, interference
   - Types: WLAN, WPAN, WWAN, Mesh

4. I/O
   - Touch: occlusion, fat finger, no hover
   - Gestures: non-standard, hidden
   - Speech: limited usage
   - Sensors: relative motion only
   - Vision: lighting issues

5. CONTEXT
   - Environment: motion, sound, light
   - Social: norms, privacy
   - Activity: walking vs sitting
   - Recognition challenges

6. SECURITY & PRIVACY
   - Sensitive data targets
   - Weak encryption adoption
   - Cloud: third-party trust

7. SUSTAINABILITY
   - Short lifecycle, high CO2 footprint
   - Solutions: right-to-repair, modular phones
