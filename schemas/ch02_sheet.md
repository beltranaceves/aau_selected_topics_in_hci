# Networks & Location

    NETWORKS
      - Multiplexing: TDMA (time slots), FDMA (frequency slots), CDMA (code separated)
      - WPAN (Bluetooth): FHSS, Classic vs BLE
      - WLAN (WiFi): OFDM/OFDMA, AP topology, roaming
      - WWAN: GSM(TDMA), UMTS(CDMA), LTE(OFDMA), 5G (IP-only, IoT, microcells)

    LOCATION
      - Classes: Geographic, Topological, Cell-based
      - Satellite (GPS, etc.): TDOA, 4+ satellites, high accuracy, high power
      - WLAN: ~10 m; Cell towers: ~100–1000 m
      - Tradeoff: accuracy ↔ battery usage
      - Coordinate systems: WGS-84 vs GCJ-02
      - Cell-based issues: DB coverage, privacy, moving WiFi APs
