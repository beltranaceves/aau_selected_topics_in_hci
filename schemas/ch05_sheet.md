# Mixed Reality

    MIXED REALITY
      - AR exists within virtuality continuum
      - Requirements: real+virtual, real-time, 6D alignment

    HARDWARE
      Optical ST HMD: direct view, no occlusion, alignment issues
      Video ST HMD: better alignment, but parallax, motion sickness
      Issues: brightness, FOV, comfort, lag, safety

    TRACKING
      GPS+IMU: large-scale, low precision
      Stereo/depth cameras: hardware-based depth
      Marker-based: fiducials, SIFT
      SLAM: single camera, builds map and pose; basis of ARKit/ARCore

    SPATIAL AR
      Projection mapping; industrial support systems

    INTERACTION
      Touchscreen, tracked tools, hand tracking

    APPLICATIONS
      Ads, military, education, maintenance, gaming, medical, navigation

    VR (mobile)
      Inside-out tracking, limited space, locomotion research
