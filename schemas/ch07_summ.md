# **Interactive Surfaces & Spaces — Schematic Overview**

***

# **1. Definitions**

## **1.1 Interactive Surfaces**

Characteristics:

*   2D position tracking (optionally “2.5D” = shallow depth). 
*   1D rotation. 

### **Surface Input Types (cf. TUIO 2.0)**

*   **Multi‑touch:** 2D position, rotation, hover. 
*   **Pen/Stylus:** ID, position, rotation, angle, pressure, hover. 
*   **Tokens (tangibles):** ID, position, rotation. 
*   **Blobs:** 2D position, rotation, shape (e.g., hands, objects). 

***

## **1.2 Interactive Spaces**

Characteristics:

*   **3D position + 3D rotation = 6D pose.** 

### **Space Input Types**

*   Tracked objects with full 6D pose. 
*   Tracked controllers (pose + buttons). 
*   Hand pose (all joints tracked). 
*   Full‑body pose tracking.

## **1.3 Differentiation Questions**

Used to evaluate boundaries:

*   Is a tablet / smartphone an interactive surface?
*   Does wearing an MR headset create an interactive *space*?    

These highlight the gradation between 2D vs. 3D interaction environments.

# **2. Big Issues in ISS**

Similarities to mobile devices:

*   Touch issues (precision, occlusion).
*   Gesture discoverability problems.    

Unique issues:

*   **Infrastructure requirements** (tracking systems, large displays).
*   **Fatigue** from mid‑air gestures (“Gorilla arm”).
*   **Reachability** on large surfaces or walls.    

Example cultural reference: *Minority Report* gesture interfaces.

# **3. Research Context**

## **3.1 Academic Positioning**

*   ISS as an ACM conference series.
*   Requires complex hardware → smaller user base → research‑centered.    

## **3.2 Related Research Areas**

*   **Tangible Interaction (ACM TEI).**
    *   Example: Reactable, SandScape.    
*   **Mixed Reality (ACM VRST, IEEE VR).**
    *   Example: Virtual Valcamonica, MR anatomy education.

# **4. Examples (Key Case Studies)**

## **4.1 SandScape (2002)**

*   Real sand manipulated physically → projected simulations for landscapes, hydrodynamics, architecture.
*   Early tangible‑spatial interface combining physical and digital terrains.    

***

## **4.2 Reactable (2009)**

*   Tabletop synthesizer controlled via tokens.
*   Classic example of tangible interaction + visual feedback.    

***

## **4.3 Interactive Public Ads (2017)**

*   Public display overlays silhouettes of nearby people.
*   “Mirror effect” increases engagement and attention.    

***

## **4.4 Virtual Valcamonica (2018)**

*   Visualizes prehistoric rock carvings.
*   Uses shutter glasses + multi‑display setups.
*   Large‑scale tracking for collaborative exploration.    

***

## **4.5 SPLOM Wall (2020)**

*   Scatter‑Plot Matrix for large datasets on 4.1 × 2.3 m display.
*   HCI challenge: reachability of content on large walls.    

***

## **4.6 Anatomy Education (2024)**

*   Mixed reality study in shared educational spaces.
*   Focus on collaboration vs. solo usage.
