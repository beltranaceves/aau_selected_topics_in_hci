# UbiComp & IoT

    UBICOMP
      - Weiser’s vision: tabs, pads, boards, invisible computing
      - Reality: devices exist, but interactions still not seamless

    IOT
      - Everywhere connectivity; smart objects & sensor networks
      - Goals: automation, efficiency, data collection
      - Risks: surveillance, unintended inference (e.g., power meter pattern analysis)

    BIG ISSUES
      - Power: energy harvesting limited, storage challenges
      - Interaction: configuring large device ecosystems is complex
      - Privacy: BLE broadcasts trackable, MAC often not randomized
      - Security: unpatched devices → botnets
      - Standards: fragmentation, Matter emerges, Physical Web tries URL-based access

    TECHNOLOGIES
      - Wearables: new interactions (gestures, voice)
      - Mesh networks: AODV, OLSR, ZigBee, BTLE 5.1
      - LPWAN: LoRaWAN, ultra-low bandwidth, long range
      - WPAN: BLE—low power, GAP/GATT, beacons, sensors
      - NFC: RFID-based, short range, many security pitfalls
